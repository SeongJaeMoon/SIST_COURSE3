자바스크립트 내장객체

- 객체는 자바스크립트 프로그램의 대상이다.
- 내장 객체는 자바스크립트가 기본적으로 제공하는 객체이다.
- BOM(Browser Object Model)은 브라우저를 객체로 인식하고, 브라우저 자신을 프로그램으로 통제하는 방법. 예를 들어, 창 열기, 창 닫기.
- DOM(Document Object Model)은 현재 메모리에 로딩되어 있는 웹페이지를 객체로 인식하고, 웹페이지 자신을 프로그램으로 통제하는 방법. 예를 들어, 페이지 내의 특정 콘텐츠에 대한 수정, 삭제 등.
- 사용자 정의 객체

DOM(Document Object Model)
- 웹페이지를 객체로 인식한다. 엘리먼트, 속성, 콘텐츠 모두가 객체가 된다.
- 특정 객체를 찾는 탐색 과정이 필요하다. 엘리먼트 이름 기준, id 식별자(속성) 기준, name 식별자(속성) 기준, class 식별자(속성), CSS 선택자 기준.
- DOM Document, DOM Elements, DOM Attributes, DOM Events, DOM Style


Events
- 웹페이지에서 발생하는 사용자의 액션을 모두 이벤트로 받아들인다. 예를 들어, 주소 입력후 페이지 연결, 마우스 클릭, 스크롤바 이동, 키보드 타이핑, ....
- 이벤트 발생시 사전 준비된 Javascript code를 실행할 수 있다. 이벤트 핸들러, Javascript code(함수 형태)를 준비해야 한다.
- 함수 선언 형식
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3, ...) {
    code to be executed
}
주의) 매개변수 선언시 var 키워드 사용하지 않는다.
- 이벤트 핸들러는 이벤트명 앞에 on이 붙어있는 이름 사용. 예를 들어, click 이벤트의 이벤트 핸들러는 onclick.
